            Our yoga teachers are very skilled. I have a lot of experience teaching yoga in real life. They also know a lot about the ways of yoga. They bring all of that into every class. Each student gets help during the class. This helps them get better at standing, breathing right, meditating and feeling more confident when they teach.

In addition to learning how to do yoga poses you will also learn how to talk and lead others. This helps you inspire the people who come after you and make yoga moments for them.
